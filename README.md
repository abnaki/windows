
Abnaki Way Components

Small framework for .NET Windows applications, providing useful
necessities and conventions.  Such a set of components, however small,
saves the developer from unwanted application-specific code bloat, or
repeatedly consulting the Internet for answers to previously solved
problems.  Improvements in these components will benefit all
applications developed upon them.
